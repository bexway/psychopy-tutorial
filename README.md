# Tips for Installing Psychopy
There are some python dependencies the package uses for writing code without the builder. Most of them can be installed with pip, which is included with Python 2.7.10 or later. Psychopy requires Python 2.7, not 3.4 or later.

If you run into trouble installing packages, you can try installing them through the anaconda installer. It's an environment manager for Python that installs a bunch of helpful packages for you, and has a database of even more.
